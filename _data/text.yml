  I am Gianfranco Damato, I hold a BSc in Computer Science and I've been programming since I was 6 years old;  
  I'm a software developer with a penchant for **Game Development**, **Front-End Development** and **Embedded programming**.  
  
  Here you'll find some tutorials about my favourite topics, as well as my portfolio.
